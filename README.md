## 📁 Projects

These are the main Python projects from the course:

1. **Arithmetic Formatter** – Formats strings of arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side.
2. **Time Calculator** – Adds time durations and formats the result.
3. **Budget App** – Creates a budget class and generates spending charts.
4. **Polygon Area Calculator** – Calculates area and perimeter of shapes using OOP.
5. **Probability Calculator** – Simulates experiments to calculate probabilities.

Each file contains a full implementation and can be run independently.
